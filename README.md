Sleepychat
==========

Because Omegle was just getting annoying.

Built on Node.js and Socket.io, Sleepychat attempts to the problems that plauge the ways we currently use random partner text chat services with hypnosis. So what do I need? Well, I'm not comfortable hosting this from any of my servers, so a generous soul will have to offer up hosting for it. Beyond that, it just needs... you. Have fun.
